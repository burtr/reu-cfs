    "Python is being used increasingly as a language for scientific computing because of its qualities as a programing language and because of community developed libraries extending the langauges abilities. One concern with using a powerful language like Python is that it loses the efficiency of languages which run \"closer to the metal\", although the analogy should be \"closer to the silicon\". For instance, programs written in C can be very efficient to run but they are not efficient to code. C codes slowly and requires extreme attention to detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SciPy initiative attempts to solve this efficiency gap, and present powerful, efficient libraries of Python code for scientific programing. Some of these libraries are written in C to truely extend the way the language represents and manipulates data. These abilities are brought into your programs using an _import_ statement, naming a package or module that contains definitions. These then become avaiable for use in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy includes NumPy for numeric arrays, MatPlotLib for making graphs, and Pandas for tabularizing and cleaning data. In this page we talk about NumPy. The entire scipy library is described at [scipy.org](https://www.scipy.org/docs.html). One might also look at the [scipy-lectures](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/index.html) tutoral.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Python Libraries__\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries in Python include packages and modules. Modules are files containing Python code that is made available for use with the _import statement_. Packages are collections of modules, represented as entire directory trees of modules. An import statement is of the form  import-as or from-import-as.\n",
    "\n",
    "Import statements must first find the module in the system enviornment, then make the contents available by populating the local namespace. A simple _import module_ command finds a file with the same name as the module name and populates a local namespace of the same name as the module name. If one wishes the local namespace name to be different, use _import module as name-. \n",
    "\n",
    "The from form of the import statement, _from module import name as name_, operates by first looking up the module, then introducing namespaces one by one, according to the trailing name-as clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Names are found by searching the system path. This path can be accessed using the path list of strings in the sys module.\n",

    "The high level of data abstration in Python exacts a price. Simple data items, such as integers or floating point numbers, are wrapped inside of objects that intervene between the programmer and the machine to allow a more conceptual use of the data object. Lists can sequence an arbitrary mixture of objects, so each element has to self-describe its type, and code must look up the proper handling of the data item on a per element basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the other extreme, a language such as C is direct with its data types. An integer in memory is just enough information to shuttle it back and forth from the CPU to operate natively, 32 bit or 64 bit, on the integer. And arrays, rather than lists, need only a number of elements in their description, because it will be assumed that, at intervals of data type size, will lie in memory one floating point number after another, or one integer after another.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy attempts to have the best of both worlds. NumPy objects, outwardly, will be Python objects, with all the convenience of highly conceptual data representation. Inside the object, however, the run-time cuts over to C data representation, and runs full throtle over a direct access to memory and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This presents restrictions. While a Python object tends to be polymorphous &mdash; support a range of types, even a heterogeneity of types, NumPy will give this up to optimize for the important cases of interest.\n",
